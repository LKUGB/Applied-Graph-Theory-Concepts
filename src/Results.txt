The maximum in degree is: 	829
The maximum in degree vertex URL is: http://www.hogsnorts.edu/


3. Is the graph strongly connected? How did you determine your response?
It is not strongly connected. I determined my response by using the "isStronglyConnected" method in the Graph class. First,
I created a function named DFS used for depth first search and check whether I can get to every vertices from the current vertex.
Second, I created a getReverse function to reverse the direction of all links in the graph. By doing this, the graph is reversed.
When we use DFS on a reverse graph, if I can reach every vertex from a reversed graph from the current vertex, then every vertex
can reach the current vertex in the original graph. Finally, I created a boolean function named isStronglyConnected to include the
DFS function and getReverse function to check whether the graph is strongly connected.


4. Is the graph weakly connected? That is, is the underlying undirected graph connected? How did you determine your response?
The graph is weakly connected. I determined it by using isWeaklyConnected function. The function first ignored the edge direction by
adding a mirrored set of edges to the original graph. For example, if A is directed to B, an edge directed from B to A is created.
Then, I traversed through the graph using DFS. If it is successful, the graph is weakly connected.


5. What is the “diameter” of the underlying undirected graph? The diameter of a graph is the largest of all the shortest paths
between any two vertices. Use Dijkstra’s method incorporating a Priority Queue (min-heap) to calculate the shortest path from
each vertex to every other vertex. Identify the largest of these shortest path values. [All edges in the undirected graph have
a cost of 1.] Use data structures in the Standard Library when possible. Don’t reinvent the wheel.
